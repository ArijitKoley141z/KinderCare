You are a senior full-stack developer with strong expertise in Streamlit, HTML, and CSS.

I have an existing healthcare web application called “KinderCare” built using Streamlit. I want to refactor and redesign this project into a professional, clean, light-themed, SaaS-style web application. Streamlit must be used strictly for backend logic, page routing, and session state management, while HTML and CSS must be used for all frontend layout and styling.

Use Streamlit only for application entry point, page routing/navigation, session state handling, and backend logic. Do not rely on default Streamlit widgets for UI layout or styling. All visual elements such as the header bar, navigation bar, hero section, cards, buttons, typography, spacing, and layout must be implemented using custom HTML and CSS via st.markdown with unsafe_allow_html enabled and st.components.v1.html where appropriate. Hide Streamlit’s default menu, footer, and header. Use wide layout and ensure the design is responsive.

The project must follow this exact file structure:

app.py as the main entry point and router
pages/dashboard.py
pages/vaccination_schedule.py
pages/vaccination_timeline.py
pages/health_timeline.py
pages/diseases_remedies.py
pages/assistant.py
assets/styles.css for global styling
assets/images for images and icons

The UI must use a light theme with a clean white or off-white background. Include a soft gradient header bar using blue to purple shades. Add a horizontal navigation bar with rounded pill-shaped buttons for Home, Dashboard, Vaccination Schedule, Vaccination Timeline, Health Timeline, Diseases & Remedies, Assistant, Login, and Sign Up. Highlight the active page in the navigation bar. The design should be minimal, modern, and professional with proper spacing and alignment.

Include a centered hero section on the home page with the title “KinderCare” and the subtitle “Your Child’s Health & Vaccination Companion.” Below the hero section, display a grid of colorful gradient cards for Dashboard, Vaccinations, AI Assistant, Health Timeline, Diseases & Remedies, and Settings. Each card must have rounded corners, soft shadows, subtle hover effects, and must be clickable to navigate to the corresponding page. Use professional fonts and consistent typography. Do not use emojis, dark theme elements, or heavy animations.

Navbar buttons and cards must route correctly to their respective pages using Streamlit routing and session state. Login and Sign Up buttons can be non-functional placeholders for now. The navbar and overall layout must be shared and reused across all pages.

Provide fully runnable Streamlit code that is compatible with Replit. Ensure frontend and backend logic are cleanly separated, CSS is reused globally, and the code is modular, readable, and production-quality. Build this as a recruiter-ready, portfolio-grade healthcare SaaS application, not a demo or tutorial.
