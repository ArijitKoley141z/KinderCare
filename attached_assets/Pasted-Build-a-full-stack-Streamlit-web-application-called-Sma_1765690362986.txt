Build a full-stack Streamlit web application called “Smart Child Vaccination & Health Assistant”.

The application should be user-friendly, medically responsible, and scalable, designed for parents to track and manage their child’s vaccination and health timeline.

1️⃣ Core Technology Stack

Frontend & Backend: Streamlit (Python)

Database: SQLite (local) or PostgreSQL (production-ready)

APIs:

Vaccination guidelines: India (UIP), WHO, CDC

Notifications: Twilio (SMS), SMTP (Email)

AI/NLP:

Chat + Voice Assistant using OpenAI / Whisper / Speech-to-Text

Rule-based + AI-assisted health guidance

2️⃣ Feature: Personalized Vaccination Scheduler

Implement a module that:

Collects:

Child’s name

Date of birth

Country selection (India / WHO / CDC)

Auto-generates a vaccination schedule based on official guidelines.

Detects missed or delayed vaccines and updates schedule dynamically.

Displays:

Upcoming vaccines

Overdue vaccines

Completed vaccines

Allows marking vaccines as “Completed”.

3️⃣ Feature: Health Timeline & History

Create a visual timeline that includes:

Vaccination history

Past illnesses and symptoms

Doctor visits (optional)

Timeline should be:

Chronological

Filterable by category (vaccine / illness / symptom)

4️⃣ Feature: Smart Reminders & Alerts

Implement automated reminders:

SMS reminders before vaccine due dates

Email reminders for upcoming or missed vaccines

In-app notifications using Streamlit alerts

Reminder logic:

7 days before

1 day before

On due date

5️⃣ Feature: Voice & Chat-Based Assistant

Add an AI assistant that:

Supports text and voice input

Understands natural language queries like:

“When is the next vaccine due?”

“My child has a cough, what should I do?”

“Which vaccines are missed?”

Assistant should:

Fetch answers from stored child data

Provide non-diagnostic medical advice

Clearly show disclaimers like:
“This is not a substitute for professional medical advice.”

6️⃣ UI / UX Requirements

Clean medical-grade UI

Sidebar navigation:

Dashboard

Vaccination Schedule

Health Timeline

Assistant

Settings

Responsive layout

Charts using Plotly / Altair

7️⃣ Security & Ethics

Store data securely

No public exposure of personal data

Explicit medical disclaimers

Opt-in for notifications

8️⃣ Deliverables

Complete Streamlit app

Modular Python code

Database schema

Clear instructions to run locally

Future-ready structure for deployment

The output should be production-quality, well-commented, and easy to extend.

🔹 Pro Tip (Important for Evaluation & Placement)

If this is a college or placement project, add this line at the end:

Design the project so that it demonstrates real-world problem solving, data handling, and AI integration suitable for MNC technical evaluations.
