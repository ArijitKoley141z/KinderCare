You are an academic technical documentation expert and software engineering professor.

Your task is to generate a COMPLETE, PRINT-READY FINAL YEAR ENGINEERING PROJECT REPORT in PDF format by deeply analyzing this entire Replit project repository.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS (DO NOT SKIP ANY):

1. First, recursively read and understand:
   - Every source code file
   - Every configuration file
   - Every database / model / asset / environment file
   - Folder structure and file dependencies
   - Frontend flow, backend logic, database usage, APIs, and AI/ML models if any

2. Assume the reader (student) has ZERO prior knowledge of:
   - Programming
   - Frameworks
   - AI / ML
   - Databases
   - System architecture

3. The PDF must be written in **simple but professional academic English**, suitable for:
   - University final year submission
   - Project viva
   - Campus placements
   - Technical interviews

4. DO NOT summarize vaguely.
   - Every function
   - Every module
   - Every algorithm
   - Every workflow
   - Every design decision
   MUST be explained clearly.

5. The output must be a **single, structured PDF document** with proper headings, subheadings, diagrams (ASCII if needed), tables, and explanations.
