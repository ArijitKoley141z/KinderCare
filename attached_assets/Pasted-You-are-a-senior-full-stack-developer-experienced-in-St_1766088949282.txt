You are a senior full-stack developer experienced in Streamlit, HTML, and CSS.

I have an existing Streamlit-based healthcare web application called “KinderCare”.
I want to refactor and redesign it into a professional, light-themed, SaaS-style web app using Streamlit for backend & routing and HTML/CSS for frontend layout and styling.

CORE ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS

Use Streamlit strictly for:

Application entry point

Page routing / navigation

Session state

Backend logic

Use HTML + CSS for ALL UI design:

Top header bar

Navigation bar

Hero section

Card grid

Buttons, typography, spacing

Do NOT use default Streamlit widgets for layout or styling.

Hide Streamlit’s default menu, footer, and header.

Use st.markdown(..., unsafe_allow_html=True) and st.components.v1.html() where needed.

Use wide layout and responsive columns.

MANDATORY FILE STRUCTURE
app.py                     # main entry point and router
pages/
  dashboard.py
  vaccination_schedule.py
  vaccination_timeline.py
  health_timeline.py
  diseases_remedies.py
  assistant.py
assets/
  styles.css                # global light theme styles
  images/

UI / DESIGN REQUIREMENTS (LIGHT THEME)

Clean white / off-white background

Soft gradient header bar (blue → purple)

Horizontal navigation bar with rounded pill buttons

Active page highlighted

Minimal, modern SaaS look (no clutter)

Centered hero section:

Title: KinderCare

Subtitle: Your Child’s Health & Vaccination Companion

Grid of colorful gradient cards:

Dashboard

Vaccinations

AI Assistant

Health Timeline

Diseases & Remedies

Settings

Cards must have:

Rounded corners

Soft shadows

Hover effects

Clickable navigation

Use professional fonts (system fonts are fine)

No emojis

No dark mode

No heavy animations

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Navbar buttons must route to their respective pages

Card clicks must navigate to corresponding pages

Login / Sign Up buttons can be UI placeholders

Use Streamlit session state to track active page

Shared navbar and layout across all pages

OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS

Provide fully runnable Streamlit code

Ensure compatibility with Replit

Keep frontend and backend logic cleanly separated

Reuse CSS and layout components

Code must be production-quality and portfolio-ready

Build this as a professional healthcare SaaS-style application, suitable for resume, portfolio, and recruiter evaluation, not a demo or tutorial.
